# Online Reservation System (Console-based)

This is a simple **console-based reservation system** implemented in Python. It allows users to **make reservations**, **view all reservations**, and **cancel reservations**. The system captures details such as name, date, total members, room number, and ID number, and assigns a unique reservation ID to each booking.

## Features

- **Make a Reservation**: Input your name, date, number of members, room number, and ID number to make a reservation.
- **View Reservations**: Displays all current reservations with their details.
- **Cancel a Reservation**: Cancel a reservation using the unique reservation ID.
- **Auto-Generated Reservation IDs**: The system automatically generates a unique ID for each booking.
